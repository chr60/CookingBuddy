Limitations:

In our first task, viewing recipes, we didn’t code the backend database that will be needed to hold all the recipes and access them as necessary. Since there are no recipes there yet, we just implemented an empty recipe to appear when the user clicked on one recipe to simulate the button click experience.

In our second task, using search, the same thing as before is the case in that since none of our databases are coded, we could not perform an actual search, however dummy data was implemented. This example of light hardcoding was deemed acceptable by the team as it is easy to reverse and nothing too in depth.

In our third task, adding steps to the recipe, the button functionality works to take you from view to view of adding an image but not text or audio as those steps are repetitive and not needed for this yet. While the camera/microphone isn’t hooked up yet, we have started in looking at how to implement that already. There are also two screens that happen after the main menu but before adding steps. These two screens are naming your recipe and creating an ingredients list. As stated before, we chose to eliminate these screens in order to focus on more challenging views.
